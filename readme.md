Bubble sort,is a simple sorting algorithm that
repeatedly steps through the input list element by
element, comparing the current element with the
one after it, swapping their values if needed.

The aim of the project is to visualise the Bubble
Sort process which includes the following steps:

1.  Generate a random number between 1 - 100 and
    then store it in an array.

2.  Then design bars for the same value and apply
    appropriate styliling such that it represents
    each element's position within the array.

3.  After this, sort them using bubble sorting
    algorithm.

4.  Using JavaScript control the sorting prosses
    of the array such that it gives the visual
    representation of sorting.

5.  Finally display the sorted elements on screen.
